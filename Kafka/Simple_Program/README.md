These are simple Python programs on Kafka producer and consumer.

To execute, first start the zookeeper server and the kafka server. 
Then run the producer program followed by the consumer, which will show the output.

Note that if you stop the consumer before all messages are printed, it will resume from the same number where it stopped before if you start it again.
